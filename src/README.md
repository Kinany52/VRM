# VRM
VRM stands for Vendor Return Management. As the name implies, it is a platform to manage returns of an online marketplace, ideally one with multiple vendors and/or multiple warehouses.  
Tracking and managing returns, be it from withdrawal period or warranties, can be quite hectic, if multiple vendors are involved. If not managed correctly, returns can cause financial issues for both customers and the marketplace internally. To make these issues concrete, customers might not be refunded for the orders they return (either within the specified withdrawal period or within the frame of warranty period) and the marketplace itself could misscalculate its finances and its financial reports due to the pending customer refunds that are not confirmed by the multiple vendors' warehouses and the incorrect vendor invoices, caused by unverified returns. Thus, this platform can play the role of a virtual and mutual warehouse for all the vendors, whose products are sold under the umbrella of the single marketplace.
